When was the last \n time we had an (openly) atheist president?  Have we ever?  (I don't \n actually know; these aren't rhetorical questions.)  How 'bout some \n Supreme court justices?   \n  \n One thing that really ticked me off a while ago was an ad for a news \n program on a local station...The promo said something like 'Who are \n these cults, and why do they prey on the young?'  Ahem.  EVER HEAR OF \n BAPTISM AT BIRTH?  If that isn't preying on the young, I don't know what \n is... \n  \n I used to be (ack, barf) a Catholic, and was even confirmed...Shortly \n thereafter I decided it was a load of BS.  My mom, who really insisted \n that I continue to go to church, felt it was her duty (!) to bring me up \n as a believer!  That was one of the more presumptuous things I've heard \n in my life.  I suggested we go talk to the priest, and she agreed.  The \n priest was amazingly cool about it...He basically said that if I didn't \n believe it, there was no good in forcing it on me.  Actually, I guess he \n wasn't amazingly cool about it--His response is what you'd hope for \n (indeed, expect) from a human being.  I s'pose I just _didn't_ expect \n it...   \n  \n I find it absurd that religion exists; Yet, I can also see its \n usefulness to people.  Facing up to the fact that you're just going to \n be worm food in a few decades, and that there isn't some cosmic purpose \n to humanity and the universe, can be pretty difficult for some people.  \n Having a readily-available, pre-digested solution to this is pretty \n attractive, if you're either a) gullible enough, b) willing to suspend \n your reasoning abilities for the piece of mind, or c) have had the stuff \n rammed down your throat for as long as you can remember.  Religion in \n general provides a nice patch for some human weaknesses; Organized \n religion provides a nice way to keep a population under control.   \n  \n Blech. \n  \n Chris \n  \n  \n ---------------------- \n Chris Leger \n Sophomore, Carnegie Mellon Computer Engineering \n Remember...if you don't like what somebody is saying, you can always \n ignore them! \n  \n "

Pk., MD 20742 \n Lines: 43 \n  \n Jon Livesey writes: \n  \n >So why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had 'different \n >versions' of some OT texts.   Did I misunderstand? \n  \n Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in \n the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of \n religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a 'real' \n story (that is, a bigger headline). \n  \n Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the \n various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the \n Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the \n standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has \n obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. \n These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and \n to the Septuagint. \n  \n Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: \n first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are \n variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to 'fixing'/predating \n the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of \n my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and \n have little theological import. \n  \n The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of \n Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There \n is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no \n sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the \n septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations \n between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the \n septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the \n differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big \n expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the \n material, but so far this hasn't happened. \n  \n The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the \n OT, unlike for the NT. \n --  \n C.

However, note that Begin compares \n wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of \n wounded Arabs.  Guess why. \n  \n >was thus very severe.

_54222	10	"From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu) \n Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45) \n Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University. \n Lines: 85 \n  \n #21\tPETER AHOLA\t\tSeason: 2nd \n Acquired:\t'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations \n Grade:\t\tI (B) \n  \n It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the \n Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had \n only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose \n Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he \n has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been \n spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); \n it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn \n out to be ... Peter Ahola. \n  \n #24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th \n Acquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and \n \t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft \n Grade:\t\tI (B) \n  \n I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high \n expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. \n Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and \n playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, \n unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to \n catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for \n 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be \n Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor. \n  \n #29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd \n Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft \n Grade:\t\tI (C-/D+) \n  \n It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of \n games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's \n quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, \n he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of \n the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with \n the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward \n with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in \n his level of performance to have any chance of making the team. \n  \n #38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd \n Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft \n Grade:\t\tI (?) \n  \n MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my \n memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to \n use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that \n he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with \n Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, \n a 'rehab assignment' that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. \n Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but \n he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive \n skills. \n  \n #41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st \n Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft \n Grade:\t\tI (B+) \n  \n Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated \n by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours \n truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in \n 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9', 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after \n he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, \n on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. \n But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance \n on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league. \n  \n #45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st \n Acquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft \n Grade:\t\tI (D+/D) \n  \n He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly \n umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a \n small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is \n quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or \n defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that \n will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he \n was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre. \n  \n =============================================================================== \n GO CALGARY FLAMES!

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the \n     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire \n     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel \n     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX' \n     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like \n     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed \n     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly \n     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common \n     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to \n     150MPH.) \n  \n     Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed \n     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find \n     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load \n     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous \n     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is \n     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum \n     per-tire loads: \n  \n     Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157 \n     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125 \n  \n     Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. \n  \n     In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire \n     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation \n     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application \n     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters \n     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of \n     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For \n     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference \n     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at \n     all. \n  \n     If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. \n  \n     Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating \n     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) \n  \n     There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, \n     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded \n     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is \n     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they \n     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are \n     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. \n  \n Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put \n     normal tires on the car? \n  \n A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin. \n     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible \n     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them \n     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that \n     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.) \n     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your \n     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly \n     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, \n     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard \n     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear \n     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires. \n  \n Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side \n     of my car? \n  \n A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many \n     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a \n     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others \n     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping \n     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before \n     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations. \n  \n Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the \n     car should I put them on? \n  \n A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't \n     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow \n     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there \n     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear \n     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car \n     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car \n     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start, \n     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the \n     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes \n     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards. \n  \n Radar Detectors and Speed Limits: \n  \n Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits \n     in this Q&A posting? \n  \n A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between \n     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless \n     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please \n     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there. \n  \n Safety Equipment: \n  \n Q:  Do airbags really work? \n  \n A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much \n     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than \n     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than \n     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend \n     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the \n     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but \n     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention \n     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult. \n  \n Brake Questions: \n  \n Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas \n     always wants to do this. \n  \n A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing \n     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors \n     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped \n     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or \n     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas \n     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical \n     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped, \n     or badly grooved. \n  \n Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is \n     this really a good idea? \n  \n A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade \n     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of \n     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases \n     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more \n     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they \n     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings. \n  \n     On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA \n     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I \n     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to \n     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a \n     car with an automatic to take the test. \n  \n Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid? \n  \n A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to \n     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake \n     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type \n     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The \n     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry \n     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling \n     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest \n     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better \n     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling \n     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see \n     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that \n     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific \n     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly \n     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ \n     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for \n     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out \n     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid \n     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly. \n  \n Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids? \n  \n A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks \n     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone \n     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and \n     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound \n     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in \n     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any \n     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend \n     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where \n     most of the corrosion occurs. \n  \n     Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to \n     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly \n     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the \n     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids. \n  \n     Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are \n     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which \n     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they \n     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they \n     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable \n     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense \n     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not \n     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the \n     economics are questionable for street use. \n  \n     I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard \n     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably \n     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little \n     information at this time. \n  \n Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs \n     more.  Is it worth it? \n  \n A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will \n     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer \n     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally \n     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does \n     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques), \n     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques \n     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case. \n  \n     Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the \n     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able \n     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several \n     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is \n     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence \n     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed \n     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and \n     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original \n     equipment or OE-equivalent components. \n  \n     When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking \n     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the \n     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS \n     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a \n     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could \n     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is \n     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as \n     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are \n     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system \n     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this \n     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking; \n     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform \n     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on \n     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes \n     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars, \n     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this \n     eventuality. \n  \n     A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves \n     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are \n     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release \n     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off \n     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied. \n     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly. \n  \n     An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical \n     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on \n     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much. \n     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an \n     ABS system in your car. \n  \n     As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential \n     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the \n     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder \n     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master \n     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for \n     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 \n     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of \n     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system \n     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid \n     becomes very important. \n  \n Q:  What about this threshold braking business? \n  \n A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent \n     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers \n     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is \n     needed here -- rpw] \n  \n     Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high \n     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab \n     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much \n     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate \n     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but \n     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold \n     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn \n     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake \n     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the \n     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it. \n     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're \n     not very near the threshold. \n  \n     In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just \n     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on \n     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very \n     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better \n     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS \n     take over. \n  \n     Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of \n     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with \n     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed \n     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now \n     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the \n     involved officers had any recent performance driving training. \n     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing \n     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique \n     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to \n     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you \n     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must \n     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least \n     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that \n     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason. \n     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective \n     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if \n     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at \n     the pedal will be sufficient.     \n  \n Gas Questions: \n  \n Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help? \n  \n A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the \n     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used. \n     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your \n     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car \n     needs. \n  \n Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it? \n  \n A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear, \n     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase \n     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded \n     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however, \n     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not \n     actually require leaded gasoline. \n  \n Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use? \n  \n A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use \n     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems. \n     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl \n     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs \n     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection. \n  \n     Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes \n     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's \n     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider \n     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol \n     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected \n     cars. \n  \n     An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with \n     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that \n     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain \n     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything \n     in your gas tank. \n  \n     There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are \n     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work \n     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1, \n     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these, \n     once every six months, is highly recommended. \n  \n Q:  What about detergent gasolines? \n  \n A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW \n     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this \n     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test \n     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such \n     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional. \n     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean \n     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits. \n  \n Lubrication Questions: \n  \n Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean? \n  \n A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter \n     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t \n     uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are \n     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine \n     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels \n     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE, \n     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth. \n  \n     The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either \n     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by \n     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly \n     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile \n     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the \n     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold; \n     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity \n     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually \n     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What \n     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity \n     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast \n     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the \n     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil. \n  \n     Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not \n     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all \n     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the \n     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has \n     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils \n     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30, \n     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though. \n  \n Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good? \n  \n A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out \n     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure \n     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on \n     your wallet at all times. \n  \n Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good? \n  \n A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have \n     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based \n     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the \n     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general, \n     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET \n     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight \n     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term \n     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are \n     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the \n     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes \n     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners \n     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of \n     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 \n     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as \n     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are \n     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives. \n  \n     On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world. \n  \n Q:  Do synthetic oils really work? \n  \n A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics, \n     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by \n     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to \n     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your \n     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change \n     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty \n     as conventional oils. \n  \n     Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter \n     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very \n     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however. \n  \n Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals. \n     How often should I change my oil? \n  \n A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always) \n     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs \n     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however, \n     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you \n     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up \n     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often, \n     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are \n     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car \n     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change \n     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter, \n     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out \n     of storage. \n  \n Misc. Questions: \n  \n Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they \n     break.  What's the story? \n  \n A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts, \n     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but \n     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt. \n     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be. \n  \n     If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the \n     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent \n     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if \n     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time \n     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have \n     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize, \n     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage \n     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water \n     pump can be a costly mistake.) \n  \n Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it \n     self destructs when the timing belt breaks? \n  \n A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the \n     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression \n     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are \n     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance \n     oriented vehicles. \n  \n Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration? \n  \n A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety \n     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be \n     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the \n     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report \n     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator \n     is probably the cause. \n --  \n richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com \n ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of \n   a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith \n "

And key size is one of the things that can be \n    verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the \n    chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the \n    output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output \n    bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change. \n  \n    If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that \n    some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that \n    they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast, \n    DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output \n    change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think \n    NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught. \n  \n Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and \n not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system \n makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now \n only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits \n wouldn't turn up anything interesting. \n  \n    Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see \n    the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased \n    subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb. \n  \n The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but \n I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy \n which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search \n take far less than 2^80 encryptions.

The net result of this is \n that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the \n National Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances \n of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions. \n  \n I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer \n to Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with \n nature on it's own terms. \n  \n Guy \n "

Some \n >send data to both, some only send data to the left channel \n >(the first is preferrable, of course) \n  \n Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound. \n  \n The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to \n make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values \n into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was \n because \n of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by \n scanning \n this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on \n some machines). \n  \n When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to \n generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had \n once \n documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant 'I \n want to \n play a mono sound' and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted \n the \n documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers \n of \n sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you \n want \n to make stereo sound. \n  \n Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are \n inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from \n the \n IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game \n writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy. \n  \n Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output \n hardware, \n and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase \n works. \n On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase \n gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra \n 700/900/950 \n at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel \n only. \n Both are technically correct interpretations of the original \n specification, \n but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons. \n  \n If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono \n sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the \n underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left \n channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their \n games will only come out the left on some games. \n  \n The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound \n on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related. \n It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of \n the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which \n are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what \n machine \n you have. \n  \n Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list: \n >Lemmings \n >Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW) \n >Glider 4.0 \n >OIDS \n and also \n Hellcats, \n Super Tetris \n Oxyd \n (and many more, these are just what I've tested) \n  \n Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras. \n  \n  \n Other games you list: \n >Armor Alley \n >Spectre \n >Spaceward Ho! \n and also \n PGA Tour Golf \n Civilization \n (and more, these are again only from personal experience) \n  \n Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines. \n  \n The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT! \n Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to \n do, \n but I'm going say it anyway. \n Stop cheating on sound! \n Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers \n will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period \n is about to end. \n The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will \n work \n even better soon, so use it. \n  \n In conclusion: \n To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug. \n To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send \n sound \n to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of \n automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all \n hardware. \n  \n  \n Have fun. \n  \n Disclaimer number 1: \n I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed. \n So don't write me with sound questions. \n  \n Disclaimer number 2: \n If it says up above that I wrote anything like 'the grace period is about \n to end' then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not \n allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean. \n  \n Disclaimer number 3: \n I don't speak for Apple, just me. \n  \n -Steve Bollinger \n "

Michael \n Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution \n of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural \n assumptions that are independent of these rules. \n   \n > ... The Great  Commandment is, more than anything else, a call \n > to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* \n > in your every action. ... \n  \n The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed, \n in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if \n he has 'ultimate responsibility.' Indeed, many traditions present \n an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret \n loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and \n relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely \n because it would be wrong for man to assume such 'ultimate \n responsibility.' Once again, we are confronted with good sounding \n goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.  \n  \n > ...

There \n are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward \n reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way. \n Michael cannot refer to 'base' claims or base commandments to \n show that such readings are 'twisted,' because this divergence in \n understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the 'base' \n claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians, \n Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions \n that these conservative Christians will reject.   \n  \n > But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our \n > society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It \n > may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems \n > -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again. \n  \n But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  'a \n principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.' The meaning of \n these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular \n and cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how \n the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of \n other Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition, \n or from some combination of these things.  These commandments \n lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for \n criticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from \n the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments.  \n  \n > And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged \n > *different* 'ethical systems' (or in some cases, none).

The one, single, thing in the gospels \n > which Jesus specifically 'gives' as 'a commandment' to us is 'love \n > one another.' \n  \n Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which \n would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what \n it means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many* \n parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are \n straightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline \n epistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all \n come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior, \n the problem is *not* a lack of raw material.  \n  \n -*---- \n > I am a 'radical' Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously. \n  \n No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel  \n seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the \n gospel. \n  \n > ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me \n > tell you something about Christianity? ... \n  \n In a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us \n something about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament \n authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve \n as the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the \n nature of the Christian god and about what men should and \n shouldn't do.  \n  \n The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per \n se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and \n gays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is \n effective only through the extra-Christian principles through \n which Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply \n the *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to \n their cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that \n make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would \n be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by \n Christian interpretation.   \n  \n Michael paints a picture of 'standard American atheism' as the \n rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian \n interpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more \n damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents \n such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and \n the nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by \n an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I \n think we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can \n have its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the \n lukewarm we should spit out.  \n  \n Russell \n "

I think a good lock and some common sense about \n where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my \n spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of \n my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in \n relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to \n manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two \n bikes :( and no, he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much \n hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8 \n weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company \n to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin. \n  \n Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US \n but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article \n is: \n \tMichael Brandon Ltd, \n \t15/17 Oliver Crescent, \n \tHawick, \n \tRoxburgh TD9 9BJ. \n \tTel. 0450 73333 \n  \n The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required. \n  \n Don't lose it \n \tIan \n  \n --  \n _______________________________________________________________________ \n   Ian Harvey, University College Swansea         Too old to rock'n'roll \n   eeharvey@uk.ac.swan.pyr                              Too young to die \n                               '79 GS750E                               \n  \n  \n "

If it were, it \n would be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners, \n but it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents \n which they claim are violated if you actually 'make, use or sell' PGP. \n I believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent \n lawyer or anything. \n  \n There is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which \n can be used in North America without legal entanglements.

Like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable \n legally.  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI, which a \n number of people have received in the past.)

EDT \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \n agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \n against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \n weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. \n Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \n standoff ensued. \n  \n      The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \n reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \n bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \n ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \n dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \n insane. \n  \n      He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \n federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \n responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \n action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \n towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \n provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \n agents against the compound. \n  \n      This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \n an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \n Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. \n The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \n in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \n permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \n in the compound to come outside and to surrender. \n  \n      I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \n discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \n thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \n she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \n implementation of the decision. \n  \n      Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. \n Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \n agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \n captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \n survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \n responsibility for the carnage that ensued. \n  \n      Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \n future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \n Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \n uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \n dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \n professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \n expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \n to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \n cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \n continue to be fully accountable to the American people. \n  \n      I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \n General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \n front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \n circumstances. \n  \n      Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \n for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \n of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \n tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \n Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \n the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \n situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \n be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \n will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \n has been learned now. \n  \n      Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \n after 51 days, you decided -- \n  \n      Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \n that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \n with -- \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \n first and then the other. \n  \n      Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno -- \n  \n      Q  Mr. President -- \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \n can't do it at once. \n  \n      Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \n the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \n that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \n step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \n described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \n to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \n permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \n very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \n hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. \n  \n      I was further told that under no circumstances would our \n people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \n shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \n there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \n lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. \n There were no shots coming back from the government side. \n  \n      I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \n asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \n I was given were the following: \n  \n      Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \n federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \n quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \n needed in other parts of the country. \n  \n      Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \n never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \n that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \n be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \n members to come out. \n  \n      Number three, that the danger of their doing something \n to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \n the passage of time. \n  \n      And number four, that they had reason to believe that \n the children who were still inside the compound were being abused \n significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \n unsafe conditions. \n  \n      So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. \n The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \n given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \n evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \n that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \n convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \n increase with the passage of time. \n  \n      The third question I asked was, has the military been \n consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \n that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \n that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \n people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \n of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \n military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \n had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \n minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \n -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \n significance. \n  \n      Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \n said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \n should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \n today. \n  \n      Q  Mr. President -- \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead. \n  \n      Q  Can you address the widespread perception -- \n reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \n trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \n reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \n reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \n add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \n late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \n had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \n custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \n to unfold. \n  \n      There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \n speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \n on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday. \n I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \n King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \n is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \n happen when the federal government is in control. \n  \n      I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \n would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \n Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \n murdered themselves.  (Applause.) \n  \n      I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \n life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \n people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \n heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \n and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \n avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \n themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \n children. \n  \n      But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \n is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \n to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \n you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \n said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \n children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \n unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \n with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \n that.  So that is where I think things stand. \n  \n      Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \n mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \n patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \n decide that way? \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \n is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \n done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \n time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \n World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \n to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \n should have known?  Is there some other question they should have \n asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \n for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \n the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \n the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \n some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \n totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \n evidence we have. \n  \n      There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \n fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \n again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \n particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \n important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \n people who killed others and then killed themselves. \n  \n      Q  Mr. President, were there any other options \n presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \n February 28th until yesterday? \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \n along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \n back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \n job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \n any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \n early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \n the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \n be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \n authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \n just began to spin downward. \n  \n      Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \n yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \n involve other options except whether we should take more time with \n the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \n wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \n people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. \n That's what they thought. \n  \n      Q  Did the government know that the children did not \n have gas masks? \n  \n      Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \n you in agreement with that? \n  \n      THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \n whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \n Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \n in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \n congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \n cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \n most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \n country. \n  \n    (more, more) \n  -30- \n "

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the 'wild \n >idea' stage or does it have real funding? \n    \n     Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the \n Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize: \n    \n SPACE ADVERTISING \n     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very \n common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the \n space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the \n (very prominent) logos on its side of \n    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher) \n    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite) \n    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and \n    - the GPS/Navstar program office \n    This has not been considered 'paid advertising' but rather \n 'public relations', since the restrictions have been such that only \n organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the \n side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting \n a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras \n is 'advertising' as much as it is 'public relations', in my \n opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has \n rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...] \n    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials \n for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large \n advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of \n several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at \n putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload \n bay.  These ventures would be different than 'public relations', in \n that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms \n participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for \n the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For \n example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a \n Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras \n would scan past it.) \n    \n ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES \n    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about \n 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed \n to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe \n company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, \n Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last \n Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from \n participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for \n example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the \n British visiting cosmonaut to Mir. \n    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch \n vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET \n recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements \n on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie 'The Last \n Action Hero'.  Besides the usual logos of the participating \n organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the \n main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster \n rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for \n one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in \n Space News magazine a couple of months ago. \n    (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is \n talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he \n created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising \n sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the \n space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on \n the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it 'would not use \n his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and \n receiving compensation.'   This is being disputed, since the launch \n is a 'commercial launch' and NASA is receiving none of the \n advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is \n coming from NASA.) \n    \n ORBITAL 'BILLBOARDS' \n    Orbital 'billboards' have been the staple of science fiction for \n some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert \n Heinlein described another in 'The Man Who Sold the Moon'.  Several \n different potential projects have been developed, although none have \n been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the 'Eiffel \n II' project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in \n orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial. \n                                                 (cont) \n  \n --- Maximus 2.01wb \n "

You still haven't offered \n  \n I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even \n contributed a few comments) but this stuff 'I'd rather face a knife than \n a gun' has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the \n same thing, then I got 'educated.' \n  \n People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how \n quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that \n it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick \n (within a minute or so) death. \n  \n The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage \n points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are \n 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly \n only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a \n remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a \n spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter. \n  \n Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by \n accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for \n a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only \n moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a \n DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out \n of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and \n ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and \n strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks \n used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled \n slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained \n martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up \n against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as \n the attacker. \n  \n Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing \n with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a \n knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their \n knife attacks in prison. \n  \n If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize \n these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is \n the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced \n attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old \n man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about \n one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking \n cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike \n in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 \n seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons \n that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest \n with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the \n pointed end.) \n  \n Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. \n Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that \n destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve \n seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.' \n  \n This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman \n in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That \n lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All \n four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta \n girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex \n of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and \n destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball \n sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was \n out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight \n months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was \n on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think \n civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh. \n  \n The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife \n attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good \n alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk \n (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor \n them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact \n weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and \n is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a \n caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually \n do this. \n  \n Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live \n and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason \n 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep \n us alive. \n  \n I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now \n know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would \n have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I \n WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not \n fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen \n behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do \n whatever it takes. \n  \n Rick. \n "

His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's \n intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life \n and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and \n deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) \n Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the \n Cross, as Jesus willingly ('not my will, Lord, but yours') died for \n the redemption of all humankind.

My comments are based \n primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in 'The Trinitarian \n Controversy', Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh] \n  \n MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY \n   \n [SECOND CENTURY \n  \n The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much \n of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, \n Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the \n 'Apologists'.  Their theology has often been described as 'Logos \n theology'.  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less \n a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the \n Father, as his mind or thought.  This 'immanent Word' became \n 'expressed' as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. \n Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in \n history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. \n Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the \n final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, \n because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with \n the eternal plurality in the Godhead. \n  \n Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he \n was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as \n one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible \n except through his process of self-revelation (the 'economy').  The \n distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized \n the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should \n probably be called 'economic trinitarianism', though that term is \n normally used (as below) to refer to later developments. \n  \n  \n THIRD CENTURY \n  \n --clh] \n  \n Dynamic Monarchianism \n   \n Source: Theodotus \n Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians \n Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature \n and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are \n consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. \n The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict \n sense of the word. \n Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable \n impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The \n 'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the \n work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to \n a hypostatic union. \n Asignation of Deity/Eternality: \n  Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and \n without beginning or end. \n  Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in \n a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified. \n  Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality \n is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. \n Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation \n concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the \n Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical \n doctrine of salvation. \n [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism \n at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen \n as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the \n Church.  --clh] \n  \n   \n Modalistic Monarchianism \n   \n Source: Praxeas \n Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals \n (Jesus Only) \n Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is \n qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This \n essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \n They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The \n three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. \n Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous \n and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting \n of himself. The paradox of a subsisting 'three in oneness' is refuted by \n recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different \n names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. \n Asignation of Deity/Eternality: \n  Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of \n the only unique and unitary God \n  Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another \n mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God \n manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation). \n  Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the \n one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of \n regeneration and sanctification. \n Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian \n deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its \n concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such \n simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism. \n [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are \n actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his \n followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. \n Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic \n Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, \n information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there \n seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh] \n   \n [I've moved the following description to be with the other \n third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh] \n  \n 'Economic' Trinitarianism \n   \n Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian \n Adherents: Various 'neo-economic' Trinitarians \n Perception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, \n Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, \n indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially \n comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. \n Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated \n by means of such terms as 'distinction' and 'distribution' dispelling \n effectively the notion of separateness or division. \n Asignation of Deity/Eternality: \n The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in \n observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the \n Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this \n ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. \n Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the \n relational aspect of the Trinity. \n [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as \n mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in \n the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they \n did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow \n present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of \n the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in \n substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially \n orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh] \n  \n [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted \n to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms \n of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a \n mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality \n of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is 'eternally \n generated'.  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is \n eternal.  It cannot be said that 'there was once when he was not' (a \n phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son \n is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described \n as separate 'hypostases', though this may not have quite the meaning \n of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is \n one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may \n have used the term homoousios ('of the same substance').  The Holy \n Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father \n through the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but \n he pushes things in the direction of separateness. \n  \n  \n FOURTH CENTURY \n  \n --clh] \n  \n Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh] \n   \n Source: Arius \n Major Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known \n cults \n Perception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly \n identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet \n entities who do not share the divine essence. \n Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the \n concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. 'Threeness in oneness' is self- \n contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. \n Asignation of Deity/Eternality: \n  Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning. \n  Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, \n he is not of the divine essence. \n  Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed \n as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. \n Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting \n the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise \n asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, \n and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. \n [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully \n human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this \n view from adoptionism.  --clh] \n   \n Orthodox Trinitarianism \n   \n Source: Athanasius \n Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas \n Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity \n Perception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of \n one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy \n Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- \n eternal. \n Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in \n three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists 'undivided in \n divided persons.' This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation \n in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. \n Asignation of Deity/Eternality: \n In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, \n and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both \n the divine essence and function. \n Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in \n human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the \n ineffable mystery of 'three in oneness.' \n [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all \n of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which \n are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond \n to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit \n too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general \n the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard \n to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was \n based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and \n Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, \n they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one \n must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council \n of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of \n three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh] \n  \n Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

I'd really like to know.  BTW, Sherri, thanks for  \n > the DA data I find it fascinating. \n  \n Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented. \n Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches. \n My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to \n their potential, they won't need much offensive support. \n I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust. \n There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other \n pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first \n or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the \n mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most  \n runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage \n (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low  \n scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many  \n low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. \n On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, \n I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. \n They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their \n opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that \n you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. \n All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers \n like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong. \n  \n  \n Sam \n >  \n > -Dave \n >  \n >  \n >>Sherri Nichols \n >>snichols@adobe.com  \n >                                                           \n "

At that village, whose name was publicized \n throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had \n four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was \n nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab \n troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting \n was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated \n throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian \n population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the \n battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed \n at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women, \n children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the \n slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw \n away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own \n risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants \n obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their \n stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy \n was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent \n testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to \n overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the \n civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable \n casualties. \n  \n     'The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of \n revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We \n never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in \n accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am \n convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single \n unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw \n stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do \n well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2]. \n  \n     'In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency \n found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr. \n Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise \n ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise \n ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the \n bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal \n superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews \n were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of \n 'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave \n of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.' \n  \n     'The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the \n result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel. \n Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the \n Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting. \n Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main \n road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the \n Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the \n rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even \n before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir \n Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the \n way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir \n Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the \n conquest of Haifa.' \n  \n  \n [1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) 'To counteract the loss \n of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at \n Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by \n Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish \n officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this \n Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced \n to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of \n evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of \n terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at \n the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen \n battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie \n is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.' \n  \n [2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews. \n "

Edition 01 Apr 93 \n  \n This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 \n or DOS apps not running under Windows. \n  \n One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that \n their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost \n everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) \n discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept \n an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry \n errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or \n FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer \n than with the old 2400bps modem. \n  \n  \n There are three reasons for the problem: \n  \n 1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most \n    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the \n    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high \n    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and \n    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded \n    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't. \n  \n 2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and \n    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely \n    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you \n    are losing data, you may be advised that 'you need to upgrade to a \n    16550'. More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance \n    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the \n    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve \n    my own problem had never heard the term '16550' and many didn't even \n    know what a UART was. \n  \n 3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade \n    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience \n    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers \n    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this \n    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications \n    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem \n    by themselves. \n  \n If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of \n the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid \n overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers \n were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem \n card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they \n are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. \n Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be. \n  \n  \n The Hardware Situation. \n  \n The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 \n or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace \n them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft \n diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* \n bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from \n accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt. \n  \n The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with \n configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to \n 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in \n pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access \n cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but \n it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, \n see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491. \n  \n So, what UART component do you have? \n  \n Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM \n board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with \n the numbers '8250' or '16450', your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, \n and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE \n your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket \n COM board. \n  \n If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in \n Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several \n suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The 'N' chip is the normal 40-pin \n dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 \n chips without the 'A' (the 16C550C are presumably all OK). \n  \n Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those \n of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various \n IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states \n support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: \n National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 \n Chips&Technology:       82C607 \n Texas Instruments:      t16c550a \n Silicon Systems:        73M550 \n VLSI                    16C550 \n TurboCom warns about the pre-'A' Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, \n says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 \n systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them). \n  \n If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- \n market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you \n may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to \n either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to \n COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom). \n  \n Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the \n problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology \n MCT-AIO+ card from: \n  \n JDR Microdevices \n 2233 Samaritan Drive \n San Jose  CA  95124 \n (800) 538-5000 voice US \n (408) 559-1200 voice other \n (800) 538-5005 FAX US \n  \n The MCT-AIO+ (and the '+' is important) sells for $89.95.

I only needed two serial ports, \n and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based \n 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set \n the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing. \n  \n  \n The Software Situation \n  \n Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun \n problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the \n 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 \n drivers have the following limitations: \n  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps. \n  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt \n    rate of 10x during uploads. \n  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2 \n    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO). \n  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200. \n    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1 \n    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would \n    be effective. \n  - The API won't accept rates above 'CBR_128000'. \n  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even \n    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit \n    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers. \n  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4. \n  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems. \n  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port \n    speed options above 19200 bps. \n  \n These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may \n or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). \n Rumors suggest they 'may' be solved in Windows '4.0'. \n  \n You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying \n a copy of 'TurboCom', current version 1.2, from: \n  \n Bio-Engineering Research \n Pacific CommWare Division \n 180 Beacon Hill Lane \n Ashland  OR   97520-9701 \n (503) 482-2744 voice \n (503) 482-2627 FAX \n (503) 482-2633 BBS \n MCImail:    344-5374 \n CompuServe: 71521,760 \n  \n Price was around $50 as I recall.

TurboCom gets \n around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will \n set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the \n Windows APIs and dialog boxes. \n  \n I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you \n do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is \n not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) \n standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another \n 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving \n system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough \n to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm \n engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all \n by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above \n 115,200 may still be risky. \n  \n Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still \n experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and \n serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to \n buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a \n 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of \n TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of 'Windows Sources' magazine. \n I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with \n process priorities and time slices if you are a 'power user' whose \n thrashing system still runs into comm problems. \n  \n  \n Closing Soapbox Comments \n  \n The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across \n the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, \n the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be \n assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer \n companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years \n behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation \n vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the \n initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was \n subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the \n exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent \n I/O. \n  \n You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this \n situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect \n cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs 'sort of' \n work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a \n hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that \n use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money. \n  \n Regards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road \n Bob Niland                                        Suite 503 \n Internet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525 \n CompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209 \n  \n                      Copyright 1993 Robert J.

You will see the floppy disk and \n     hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static \n     precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do \n     this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back \n \tof the mac. \n   \n 3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the \n     tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up. \n     The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the \n     tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may \n     also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power \n     supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you \n     need release. \n   \n 4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon \n     SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable \n     leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard. \n     The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed \n     to release it. \n                                              \n 5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount \n  \n 6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A \n     phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop \n     it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful \n     here. \n  \n 7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the \n     right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding \n \tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then \n \tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case. \n  \n 8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM \n     slots. \n  \n 9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to \n     gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their \n \tchips facing the front of the motherboard. \n \t \n     The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in \n \tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely \n \tand firmly into a fully upright position. \n \t \n 10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the \n     tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about \n \t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into \n \tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case. \n     Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks \n     into place. \n \t \n 11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY \n     DRIVE CABLE. \n  \n 12) Replace the phillips head screw \n  \n 13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in. \n  \n 14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount \n  \n Guy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu> \n  \n "

Newcomb) \n Subject: Re: Some more about gun control... \n Nntp-Posting-Host: whale.st.usm.edu \n Organization: University of Southern Mississippi \n Lines: 145 \n  \n First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and \n erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic. \n Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of \n the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the \n writings of the era. This  is most refreshing. \n  \n Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days. \n My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend \n to several matters pertaining to the State Militia. \n  \n Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- \n nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss \n would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both \n organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State, \n Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar \n to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \n has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks \n of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary \n but are probably similar. \n  \n Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as 'all able-bodied \n citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty- \n two (62) years...'. The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National \n Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The \n National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective. \n It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion \n of this 'para-constitutional' arrangement is quite interesting in itself \n but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this \n date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing \n as anything but a Federal reserve force. \n  \n Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized \n Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other  \n States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as \n a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and \n senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill \n on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once \n a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our \n State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an \n organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will \n come from the unorganized Militia. \n  \n In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order \n the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will \n first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either \n its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the \n event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law \n provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the \n unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by \n law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia \n of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State \n does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such \n a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use \n of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen.  \n  \n It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being \n the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim. \n  \n >No, I simple stated that the people have a right to 'join a well \n >organized militia.'  And I have also stated that a militia that \n >meets once or twice a year is clearly 'well organized.'  And this \n >state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a 'right' \n >to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated \n >by Hamilton.  \n  \n Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole \n representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have \n chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist \n end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can \n be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that \n the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia \n or 'train bands' were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- \n ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to \n provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years, \n and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever, \n 'terrible and irresistible'. \n  \n These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation \n of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress \n Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear \n Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington. \n These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- \n ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard. \n  \n The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the  \n Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting \n wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The \n Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by \n the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the \n War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States \n territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional \n authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal \n Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until \n WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer. \n When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new \n member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were \n 'grandfathered'. At least one of these 'grandfathered' individuals \n refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the \n Federal Courts. \n  \n Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to \n members of a 'well organized' militia. However, the pre-Constitutional \n history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when \n The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's \n definition of 'well organized'. In the period of peace between the \n French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped \n drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution. \n Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors \n who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because \n their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not \n be so bold. \n  \n Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is \n not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton \n nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government \n and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing \n of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their \n responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the \n Constitution. \n   \n Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one \n error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The \n Constitution prohibits States from keeping 'Troops or Ships of War \n in time of Peace'. I have heard some insist this prevents States from \n maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not \n understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage. \n Today we call any large vessel a 'ship' but in the 18th century the word \n described a particular kind of vessel.  A 'ship' is a large vessel with \n three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A 'brig' has two \n masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping \n the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's \n equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles. \n 'Troops' at this time meant a full-time professional military organization. \n Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out.  \n  \n In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being \n personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia \n as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently \n both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on \n their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or \n scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia. \n --  \n Donald R.

That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed \n for poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when you \n compared the white majority they were virutally identical. \n  \n         The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. \n non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative \n conditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage of \n nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take into \n account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the \n same conditions. \n  \n         If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns, \n then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are \n arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far \n higher rate in Seattle.

(As one \n Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun control \n in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase \n in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.

Take Washington D.C., where \n gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that \n crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York. \n  \n        The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high \n or low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact \n violent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it \n was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by \n saying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be instituted \n to deal with high crime.

Remember 'Cyprus'? \n  \n >   I have to say I vehemently disagree with you, I have seen \n  \n Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established  \n a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two  \n continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and  \n Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in  \n espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and  \n Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under  \n German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National  \n Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional  \n Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic,  \n Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often  \n expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary, \n during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and \n cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication \n in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1] \n  \n 'Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) \n  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it  \n  becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon \n  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical \n  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.'  \n  \n Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - \n extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San \n Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published \n in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. \n  \n  '...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities \n   against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the  \n   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian  \n   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish  \n   and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see  \n   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors... \n   Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise  \n   to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would  \n   help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of \n   the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Did you ever read newspaper at all? \n  \n  \n 'PAINFUL SEARCH ..' \n  \n THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians \n in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about \n 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the \n four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh. \n  \n The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials \n and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid \n workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates. \n  \n The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of \n the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control \n of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations \n in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting \n retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the \n dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first \n suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. \n Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken \n Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 \n dead. \n  \n The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a \n 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  'Hojali \n Disaster', said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on \n preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman \n Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in \n the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more \n than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 \n dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman \n of the Azeri Ministry of Defence. \n  \n FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International \n Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of \n Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque \n from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. 'We  did  not count  the \n bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,' Mr \n Zen Ruffinen said. 'We have some idea since we gave the body bags \n and products to wash the dead.' \n  \n Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the \n number of  dead in the  massacre. 'Don't  get worked up.  It will \n take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,' the  43-year-old \n lawyer said at his small office. \n  \n Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to \n reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 \n wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist \n uprising in Baku in January 1990. \n  \n Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power \n three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly \n what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 \n miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians. \n  \n Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being \n the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the \n republic's forensic department. 'This  is just a small percentage \n of the dead,' said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic \n scientist. 'They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the \n chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury \n our dead within 24 hours.' \n  \n Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 \n years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and \n axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland \n snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of \n deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises \n cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's \n report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those \n believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said. \n  \n Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still \n disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six \n policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the \n names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The \n most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far \n comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a \n helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 \n February. \n  \n 'There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to \n count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream \n and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,' Mr \n Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter \n pilot. \n  \n 'People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and \n one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was \n pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but \n Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to \n return.' \n  \n There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in \n circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few \n months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali \n at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages \n taken over by Armenian forces. \n  \n THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92 \n  \n  \n HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES \n  \n AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the \n Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in \n his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of \n Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope. \n  \n 'I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,' \n the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the \n Hojali disaster. 'I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to \n be alive.' \n  \n Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity \n for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 \n days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the \n 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the \n edge of Karabakh. \n  \n 'At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard \n before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy \n machine-guns, the lot,' Mr Sadikov said. \n  \n Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction \n of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started \n fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the \n snow into a forest on the other side. \n  \n To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam \n about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, \n until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two \n Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak. \n  \n 'None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by \n a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening \n fire,' Mr Sadikov said. \n  \n Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward \n to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts \n were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his \n group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman \n son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his \n 67-year-old elder brother. \n  \n 'I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,' \n he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. 'We \n have never got any of the bodies back.' \n  \n The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. \n One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he \n struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's \n crossing, Mr Sadikov said. \n  \n Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and \n several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy \n hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three \n Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay. \n  \n As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was \n little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was \n soon to flee. \n  \n 'The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian \n rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,' Mr Sadikov said. 'I \n had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. \n They even found a bullet in my sock.' \n  \n Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the \n Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Hamas figures \n significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel \n deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to \n Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer \n version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which \n obtained and translated the tape.) \n   \n      My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a \n refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished \n high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work \n for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have \n two daughters. \n      The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine \n explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is \n Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and \n women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli] \n Security Services. \n      Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation, \n cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most \n important objective must be to put an end to the plague of \n collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and \n interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose \n the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into \n collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally, \n we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them. \n      We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70 \n percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into \n their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is \n based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many \n collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli \n Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once. \n He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an \n Israeli soldier. \n      There's another group of collaborators who perform an even \n more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men \n and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become \n collaborators. I regard the 'isqat' [the process by which a \n Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as \n greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is \n guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious \n duty to execute him. \n      A third group of collaborators is responsible for the \n distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the \n Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their \n victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and \n impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the \n drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed. \n      In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of \n uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent \n person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished \n forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after \n evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If \n after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any \n doubt, then he is executed. \n      In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against \n collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty. \n But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a \n collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for \n evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be \n irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually \n obtained in the form of a confession. \n      At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start \n off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell \n him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the \n last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the \n information we need. \n      We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has \n been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them \n confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply \n pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts \n confess as well. \n      Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an \n interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working \n for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself \n confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the \n information to us. In addition, three members of his network of \n collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this \n much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are \n very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our \n principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he \n himself confesses his crimes.  \n      A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of \n collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be \n executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of \n names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not \n mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for \n execution. \n      When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But \n after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him \n -- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators \n are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, 'What do you \n think? How should we execute you?' One collaborator told us, \n 'Strangle me.' He hated the sight of blood. \n  \n ----- \n Naftaly Stramer \t\t\t | Intergraph Electronics \n Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A     \n Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301 \n 'Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.' \n "

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew \n must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The \n land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same \n new Jew who has 'learned' to work it. Both aspects of the \n two-pronged concept of 'Hebrew labor' have racist connotations. On \n the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical \n labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other \n hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the \n Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood. \n  \n The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from \n the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and \n hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of 'Hebrew labor' to the \n history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It \n has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to \n problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this \n concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the \n closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of \n Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, 'I have no tears for those who \n get rich off of cheap labor'. 2) to furnish an answer to the \n unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for \n wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives. \n  \n The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from \n the far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work in \n their own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two \n ethnical communities and ruling over them. \n  \n "
